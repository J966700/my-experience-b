            The most challenging but yet a contrusive journey to embark on;web development.
            So since last week it has being a lot of stress with respect to my web development journey.
            Web development as they briefly talk about can be another way of making a website with some essential kits like HTML5, CSS, and probably some JAVASCRIPT.
            Gaining knowledge on these couldn't give me a go-ahead to become a web developer.Mr.Joseph Danso being my web development lecturer and somehow my mentor had already instructed us to be practicing on the web development
            with an educational app called the freecodecamp.This app has helped  me a little bit on the web development.Getting access to projects on the app has been quite another partial improvement in the web development journey.
            Getting access to the freecodecamp was not the only basic thing to get as an aspiring web developer.Web development on its own has  other essential things which needs to be processed together with it to provide a better web app.
            Hosting; another thing to make your web</p><br>
